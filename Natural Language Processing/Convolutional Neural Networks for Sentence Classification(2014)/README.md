# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification
## 1. Background
Words can be represented as lower dimensional vector via learning representations thorugh language models such as *Skip-gram, CBOW and GloVe*.
Those pre-trained word vectors shows state-of-art performance on many kinds of sentence classification benchmarks. 
Author suggests novel approach for sentence classification based on 1D convolution and pre-trained word vectors(Word2Vec).

## 2. Approach
Let each words to be represented as r-dimensional vector.
