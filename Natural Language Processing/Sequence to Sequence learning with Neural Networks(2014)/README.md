# Sequence to Sequence learning with Neural Networks
## 1. Background
Conventional deep neural networks can not be used to map sequences to sequences owing to fixed size of input layer. Sequence has unknown length, therefore can not be an input of DNN with fixed input size. 

For example, **Machine translation** is sequential problems as sentence can be expressed as **sequence of tokens**. 
To solve sequential problems, machine translation problem to be specific, authors suggests using LSTM architecture. 

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1. Mathmatical Formulation 

Let input sequence(source sentence) to be denoted as *X = (x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>T</sub>)*

Let output sequence(target sentence) to be denoted as *Y = (y<sub>1</sub> ... y<sub>T'</sub>)*

Goal of machine translation is to search sentence Y that maximizes probability *p(*y<sub>1</sub> ... y<sub>T'</sub>* | *x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>T</sub>*)*

If source sentence *X* is encoded as fixed size vector *v*, *p(*y<sub>1</sub> ... y<sub>T'</sub>* | *x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>T</sub>*)* can be formulated as below according to the law of conditional probability.

As a result, Seq2Seq encoder-decoder model parameterizes probability distribution of **next word**, given source sentence and previously translated word. 

**Training objective** is as below.

*T* denotes target sentence and *S* denotes source sentence. *log(T|S)* log probability that sequence T appears given sequence S.

### 2.2. Architecture
Seq2Seq model consists of Encoder and Decoder.

1. Encoder is composed of 4 layers LSTM with 1000 dimensional hidden state.  Encoder encodes sequence of source sentence (*x<sub>1</sub> ... x<sub>T</sub>*) to *v*, a fixed size vector. 
2. Decoder is also composed of 4 layers LSTM with 1000 dimensional hidden state. Decoder outputs most probable translation T which maximizes log probability *p(T|S)* using **left to right beam search algorithm**.
 
#### Beam Search Algorithm
During decoding process, To generate most likely sentence translation, Beam Search algorithm is used instead of Greedy algorithm.

Greedy algorithm predicts single word with largest probability at each step. However, Beam search algorithm predicts B words at each step. Image below illustrates mechanism of beam search.

Let B = 3, and Vocab size = 50000. output layer with softmax activation outputs 50000 dimensional vector.

1. At first step, decoder selects 3 words with top 3 probability(a, i, the). And probability of each 3 words are recorded(p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>3</sub>).
2. At next step, decoder outputs 50000 dimensional vector **v<sub>2</sub>** containing probability distribution of second word.
3. Then, select 3 words with top 3 probability from concatenated vector [p<sub>1</sub>**v<sub>2</sub>**, p<sub>2</sub>**v<sub>2</sub>**, p<sub>3</sub>**v<sub>2</sub>**](a dog, i am, the dog). And probability of each 3 word combinations are recorded.
4. Repeat 2, 3 until <EOS> token appears.
