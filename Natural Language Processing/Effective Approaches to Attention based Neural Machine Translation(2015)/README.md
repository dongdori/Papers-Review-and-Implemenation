# Effective Approaches to Attention based Neural Machine Translation
## 1. Background
Since sequence to sequence model architecture was introduced, performance of neural machine translation(NMT) improved rapidly.
Attention mechanism also enabled translation model to focus on certain part of source sentence during translation.
Authors suggest two types of attention based NMT model, with effectiveness and simplicity in mind.

## 2. Approach
