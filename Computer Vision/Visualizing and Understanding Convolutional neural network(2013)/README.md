# Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional neural network (2013)

## 1. Problem statement and Objectives
Deep Convolutional Neural network shows great performance on image recognition tasks. 
Nonetheless, We do not know *how this model can recognize image* and *what happens inside the convolutional layers*.
To improve the model, We have to figure out mechanism of current model. 

#### Objectives
1. Visualizing featuremaps produced by convolutional layers through deConvnet. 
2. Improve current model through analyzing results form layer feature map visualization.
